    <p>Rules of the Game</p>
    <p>1. Select a key to start.</p>
    <p>2. You have 5 incorrect guesses per word before you lose the game.</p>
    <p>3. You can only utilize the "Hint" button after first two initial attempts and before the 5th incorrect attempt.</p>
    <p>(Hint button can only be pressed once per word guess.)</p>
            
<!--first set of placeholder blanks appear (word is random)-->    
<!--initialize game on key press-->
<!--If key press is coincidental to a match in the random word, the selected letter replaces corresponding placeholder, player is allowed to continue to guess-->
<!--If key press is not coincidental to a match in the random word, an alert to try again appears and advises of how many tries are left, placeholder remains, and player is allowed to continue to guess-->
<!--Each key press (letter selected) will be recorded per word-->
<!--Player can select the "Hint" button only prior to the fifth incorrect guess, but not before two attempts of new word; button can only be selected once per word -->
<!--If the "Hint" button is pressed the corresponding image for the word will appear, and remain on the screen until a new letter is selected (button resets with each random word)-->
<!--A new letter is selected; if it is correct, the selected letter replaces the corresponding place holder, and the player is allowed to continue to guess-->
<!--If new letter is not correct, incorrect guess counter picks up from number of last incorrect guesses in the word; game is then either over, or player is allowed to continue-->
<!--If player reaches five incorrect guesses in a single word, the game is over and an alert will state so-->
<!--If player solves all ten words before the game is over, a "Congratulations! You are a Winner" alert appears and all ten images appear in a grid on the screen-->
